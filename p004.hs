 - Solution to Project Euler problem 4
 - author: Desonte Jolivet
 - Problem: A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
 - The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
 - Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.
 - 
 - Description: Generates every pair of number between 100 and 999, then checks
 - if each pairs product is a palindrome if so addes it to the list. Finally returns 
 - the largest palindrome in the list.
